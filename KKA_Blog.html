      <h1>2017 is SMART</h1>
      <h4> January 24, 2017</h4>
      <p>Another academic year is fast approaching, and it is exciting to imagine all the possibilities available to each of us as we get a chance to start afresh. As we eagerly mark our new diaries with important events, set out our goals, and look forward to new opportunities, we also feel a sense of renewal about who we are as individuals. 
      <p>Yes, this is the year of the ‘new’ and ‘better’ me. This will finally be the ‘year’ to ‘make it happen’, nothing will stand in my way! We search for well-meaning quotes to inspire and motivate ourselves, and proclaim on all our social media sites how enormously driven we are to shed our old skin, and evolve from our cocoon of yesteryear. </p>
      <p>I, like most of you, take part in this yearly ritual, but each year this happens, I question why does this desire disappear so quickly? We make the grandest plans, meticulously outline our goals, do everything we can to enable us to reach those objectives yet give up on most of these in under a month!I decided to investigate this to see how best to succeed in achieving the goals we set for ourselves.</p>
		<p>Not surprisingly, many articles highlighted the importance of setting realistic and measurable goals. Certainly, some goals are simply not achievable, or if they are, they may be unsustainable long term. Sure you can be a blonde if you have naturally dark hair, but how much maintenance will this goal require? And can you afford it, on a regular basis? We can't all be living on a Beyoncé's budget! </p></div>

		   <h1> Setting Goals</h1>
		   <br>
		   <br>
<p>One way I set goals is using the popular SMART model. I have used this previously for goal setting, and it has kept me accountable to my goals. </p>
 <h1>SMART</h1>
<p>S = Specific</p>
<p>M = Measurable</p>
<p>A = Attainable</p>
<p>R = Relevant, Rigorous, Realistic, and Results Focused</p>
<p>T = Timely and Trackable</p>
 
<p>The best thing about SMART goals is that you can apply them for a number of areas - fitness, education, writing, life... Whatever you want!
 
So now for the difficult part, I will be setting some personal SMART goals and hope to share them with you in my next post.</p>
<p>Ciao for now,</p>
<p>Ms Kay</p>
